# Attenuverter

#### What is it?
This is a four channel attenuverter.

An attenuverter reduces the amplitude of a signal and can invert it.

Depending on the knob position, the input voltage is multiplied between -1 and 1. When the knob is centered it is multiplied by zero.

#### What makes it special?
The inputs are normaled to 5v. When no input is connected, you get an adjustable constant voltage output between -5v and 5v. The potentiometers have a detent at the zero point.
