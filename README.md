# Attenuverter

A 6HP Eurorack quad attenuverter from **Schenktronics**. Each of its four channels scales a signal by anywhere from ×1, through zero, to ×−1 (inverted), with a click at zero. Every input is normalled to +5 V, so with nothing plugged in, each channel is a manual offset from −5 V to +5 V.

## Features

- 6HP Eurorack, 20 mm deep. 16 mA on +12 V and 9 mA on −12 V.
- Four channels, each turning a signal down, off, or upside down
- Center-detent knobs, so zero is easy to find by feel
- Inputs normalled to +5 V: four manual offset voltages when nothing's plugged in
- Reverse-power protection on both rails

## Fabrication

| Board | Size | Layers | Thickness | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Main PCB | 30 × 100 mm | 2 | 1.6 mm | Standard green is fine |
| Faceplate | 30 × 128.5 mm | 1 | 1.6 mm | Aluminium PCB, white solder mask, black silkscreen. Only the front copper layer is used, so FR4 works too. |
